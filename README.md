# Nowadays-Studio

__Introduction__

VR app on Android using Unity that depicts a modern apartment setting with furniture and a globe spin animation. Among a skyline of a busy downtown area, lies a lofty studio apartment where there is lots of space for lighting, animation, and furniture. There are books on the shelves, fruit on the table in the kitchen and a user can navigate around using various waypoints by tapping on the screen/pushing the cardboard button. 

__Development Process__

Google VR SDK version-1.0.3.
I started with an empty stuio apartment. 


**User Testing**

I enjoyed placing various types of furniture around the studio apartment the way I wanted to and getting more exposure to animation features. Even though it was cool to see a globe spinning in its holder, it was challenging to synchronize the rotation. I would love to make my apartment more detailed in the future.

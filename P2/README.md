It took me a week of steady work to complete this project. 

I enjoyed placing various types of furniture around the studio apartment the way I wanted to and getting more exposure to animation features. 

Even though it was cool to see a globe spinning in its holder, it was challenging to synchronize the rotation. 
I would love to make my apartment more detailed in the future. 

The Google VR SDK version I used for this build was 1.0.3.
